House Rocket is a digital platform whose business model is the purchase and sale of real estate using technology. Your main strategy is to buy good houses in great locations at low prices and then resell them later at higher prices. The greater the difference between buying and selling, the greater the company's profit and therefore the greater its revenue.

However, homes have many attributes that make them more or less attractive to buyers and sellers, and location and time of year can also influence prices. Next we will answer the following questions:

1. Filter properties by one or several zipcodes.
2. Choose one or multiple columns to view.
3. Look at the total number of properties, the average price, the average living room size, and also the average square meter price in each of the zip codes.
4. Analyze each of the columns in a more descriptive way.
5. A map with portfolio density by region and also price density.
6. Check the annual price variation.
7. Observe the daily price change.
8. Check the distribution of properties by price, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of floors and properties with water views.
