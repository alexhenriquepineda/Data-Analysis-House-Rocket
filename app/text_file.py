    In this study, we aim to deepen our analysis of the existing correlations between the physical characteristics of a property, such as its size and number of rooms, 
    with its price and location. The main focus is to understand the underlying factors influencing the property values in Seattle, one of the most dynamic and challenging 
    cities in the United States. The data used were obtained from the Kaggle platform, well-known for its Machine Learning competitions.

    The presented analysis discusses the mentioned variables and examines how they impact both the rental cost and the total value of the property, considering additional 
    charges not specified on Kaggle. We intend to comprehend, for example, how the location in a particular neighborhood can influence the rental value. Additionally, 
    we will investigate the significance of other physical characteristics of the property, such as the square footage, the number of bathrooms and bedrooms, among others, 
    in determining the total sales or rental value. We will also highlight the most expensive and affordable neighborhoods in the city.

    It is important to emphasize that this study was conducted strictly for educational purposes, as there is uncertainty regarding the impartiality or possible gaps and 
    errors in the dataset, as it has not undergone any validation process.

    So, welcome to our exploratory journey into the real estate market of Seattle!
